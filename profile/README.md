# IsoMemo is an Open Access Big Data initiative 
IsoMemo is a collaborative effort bringing together scientists who contribute and use of isotopic data. Users are able to freely submit and/or download data from/to the different databases within the IsoMemo network. IsoMemo requests that all of its partners provide their data as Open Access and include recognition of data collection and compilation efforts via references and DOIs. We aim to bringing together isotopic data from archaeology, ecology, and environmental & life sciences. 

Isotopic tracers are used across a variety of research fields to provide a rich diversity of scientific information, but lack of centralized storage limits efficient data use.

IsoMemo is NOT a database. The IsoMemo initiative brings together independent repositories of isotopic data within the fields of archaeology, ecology, and environmental & life sciences. The goals of the initiative are to make isotopic data easily findable and accessible so that it can be easily reused for research purposes. IsoMemo also promotes the creation of data standards and interoperability with other types.

Within IsoMemo each independent database self-manages and curates their data and defines metadata requirements. However, the initiative also promotes the creation of networks linking different databases.

## Structure
Several of the IsoMemo partners make available their data via their own online databases often employing user friendly graphical interfaces. Links to their websites are available via the IsoMemo partner directory.

Data collectors that do not have their own online space may be given a webspace via the Pandora data platform. This contains several useful features including, data repository with multiple  data curation options, DOI assignment, membership and membership role management, among others. IsoMemo partners with their own websites may also have their own Pandora space and provide links to their datasets to enhance data visibility.

All IsoMemo partners with a Pandora space are linked via the IsoMemo network.

## Metadata
Each IsoMemo partner is responsible for defining own metadata requirements. 
However, via our search engine we make an effort to map their data so that different datasets can be directly compared.

## Search Engine

IsoMemo developed a search engine interface to search for data among IsoMemo partners. Each partner is free to decide if data is made available via this search engine. The search engine is an R package also available online via a Shiny interface. Data can be displayed in a tabular form with multiple query options and georeferenced data can also be mapped.

This software is now in a Beta stage of development with only a few databases and fields made available. It will be fully operational in early 2022.

## Technical aspects

The IsoMemo website is implemented using HTML5 and CSS to describe the presentation of the HTML files. The employed client-side language is JavaScript while PHP is employed on the server-side.

Data is stored by IsoMemo partners at different repositories. Additional storing capabilities are offered by the Pandora data platform managed by the Max Planck Data and Computing Facility. Data made available via the IsoMemo search engine is backed up at regular intervals.

Assignment of DOIs to datasets is made via the Pandora data platform managed by the Max Planck Library.

The IsoMemo search engine is developed in R language and it includes a browser-based Shiny interface.

# Partnerships
IsoMemo is a partnership-based initiative that brings together a group of independent isotopic databases.  Rather than a hierarchical model, IsoMemo adopts a distributive model among equal partners from different research fields. This model provides flexibility since different scientific fields have specific needs (e.g. metadata requirements) that cannot be accommodated within a one size-fit-all approach of a single central repository of data. In this respect, IsoMemo functions as a network of data repositories directing users and producers of isotopic data to appropriate partners. Nonetheless, IsoMemo also promotes the definition of common data standards and data sharing among partners. Our initiative paves the way for carrying out interdisciplinary Big Data research projects. To aid with data sharing, IsoMemo is also developing Open Source search tools.
